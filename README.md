# Edinburgh_Airbnb_Investigation
A look at Airbnb listings in Edinburgh. Part of my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

I ask three questions in this notebook:

1) Can I predict the price of a listing from its review scores? I find that, using a simple linear regression model I cannot.

2) How does the average price of a listing vary by neighbourhood? In 2018, Southside is the most expensive neighbourhood (~£105 per night) while Leith is the cheapest (~£65 per night).

3) Is there a relationship between how much supply a neighbourhood adds relative to its neighbours and the change in its relative price. I use data from 2014 and 2017 and find that, although supply has gone up accross the city and prices have generally come down, there was no significant correlation amongst neighbourhoods.
